# py-ulord-api

Ulord-platform HTTP Client Library

Check out [the client API reference]() for the full command reference.

*Important*: The legacy py-ulord-api package/module will only work for Ulord-platform 0.0.1 and Python 2.7.

*Note*: This library constantly has to change to stay compatible with the Ulord-platform HTTP API. Currently, this library is tested against Ulord-platform v0.0.1. You may experience compatibility issues when attempting to use it with other versions of Ulord-platform.
